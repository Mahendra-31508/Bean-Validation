# Bean-Validation
Bean validation is a powerful mechanism used in Java programming to enforce constraints on JavaBean properties or fields. These constraints ensure that the data held within JavaBeans meets specific criteria, such as length, range, format, or any custom-defined rules. 
in this there are xhtml files to create the interface and bean validation files like hello.java and user.java which validates the data based on size,pattern,min and max constraints.
